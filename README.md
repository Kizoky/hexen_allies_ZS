## History

In 2013 I started experimenting with *Marine Express*' code, to see if I could turn that into a Hexen mod instead, so you would see Fighers, Clerics and even Mages roaming around the map helping the player out with clearing out monsters.

Unfortunately it wasn't that perfect, at that time I started learning about Doom modding so it was just a copy-pasted spaghetti.

As time went on Brutal Doom was released, and it had a really impressive AI for that time (atleast for me) so I wanted to use Brutal Doom's code as a base for V2, that wasn't perfect neither unfortunately.

**V1**: Ported from *Marine Express*

**V2**: Ported from *Brutal Doom*

**V2.1**: Bug fix attempt for AI attacking the Player randomly
